hello!! this is an explanation of what we have on [figma here](https://www.figma.com/design/0TEFlXXxJIuh4MoLBIFV7e/DeanHub-24F?node-id=1764-970&t=H7F1VNQ5rhMY4SbT-1). couple of housekeeping notesâ€”

- currently (as of 19 oct. 24) this is for mostly UX references only; the contents of the cards and the UI of the tabs/search bar for multi-student view are subject to change
- the four skeleton sections are constructed by pulling an instance of things from the **components** section onto the background; therefore if we edit anything inside the components section, all instances of the corresponding components change (think of this like objects from oop perhaps)

### overall layout

### feature scope
1. collapsible cards (collapsable function not yet prototyped here but i remember joyce already developed it and it looks excellent)
2.
